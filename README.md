# GazdalkodjCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

This project is made to help a specific Hungarian tabletop game called "Gazd√°lkodj okosan" players with the new version of the game (2010 and onwards) administrative chores. Since it's a hungarian game the UI is full Hungarian. 

# The deployed app can be found at:
[https://gazdalkodj-calculator.web.app/](https://gazdalkodj-calculator.web.app/)

# Usability

The app saves progress on every deposit or repay to localStorage. On load it check for previously loaded data. 
If said data found it can be continued, otherwise you can start a new game
